# Factors Influencing the volume of altmetrics (tweets) for social science research articles

This study investigates on the factors influencing volume of altmetrics (tweets) and discovers social science topics discussed among various categories such as retweets, post likes and followers count. Additionally, altmetrics are suggested by scrutinizing user description and classifying popularity of tweets depending upon labels such as academics/non-academics, individual/organization. Considering four more traditional metrics such as number of references, page count, number of times article cited and last usage of article (180 days). Data is collected using Web scrapping and Twitter API through Python programming. With this data, tweeters profile was classified into academic/non-academic and individual/organization. Depending upon classification, data set was summarized with required factors needs to be analysed. LASSO regression technique with Least Angle Regression algorithm is used to find important factors influencing tweet count and feature selection method. Multiple Linear Regression, ols model was performed on summarized data to find significance p-value.  Further, altmetrics were proposed upon measuring their impact with tweet count.
